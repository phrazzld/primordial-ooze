# Primordial Ooze
JavaScript toy I made to play with elementary cellular automata. Maybe I'll make it a bigger, more engaging biosimulator like [terra]... one day...

## Getting Started
The simulator is live [here]. The form inputs default to generating a new row every second based on Rule 30. Click the Spawn button to begin generating rows. Click the Meteor Strike button to clear the page of all cells.
